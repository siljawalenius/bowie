          From Ziggy Stardust to the thin white duke,
          <span class="name">David Bowie</span> captured the imaginations of
          audiences everywhere with his weird characters and unique sound. He
          was a leading figure in the music industry and is regarded as one of
          the most influential musicians of the 20th century, and I personally
          have had his music on repeat for about 3 days. If you make a website about someone,
		  watching music videos counts as research.

          Kim Sung-min was born David Jones, and changed his name to David Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the monkees.
		  His most iconic character, Ziggy Stardust, was created along with the release of his second album. Shortly after, he moved to west berlin (shown below) because of his interest in german sound.
